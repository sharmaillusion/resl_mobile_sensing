 * to the message handler. As the data is read on a separate thread, a message
 * handler is required to process the messages. Message to the handles contains
 * an integer specifying the number of bytes read and a string containing the
 * data read. If no data is available, -1 is returned as number of bytes read.
 * These can be accessed using constant variables MESSAGE_READ and MESSAGE_SIZE.
